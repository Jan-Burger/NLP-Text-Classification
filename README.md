# NLP-Text-Classification

## Abstract
Traditional machine learning models have been around for
many years. Since computing power has grown a lot over the years, the
preferred method for machine learning nowadays are neural networks.
Since the rise of neural networks, traditional machine learning models
have moved into the background of research. Thatâ€™s why in this paper
I want to focus on the traditional approach of machine learning and
ask the question of which traditional machine learning model has the
best performance on the task of text classification of twitter data. My
research is based on the data set of Thomas Davidson, Dana Warms-
ley, Michael Macy, and Ingmar Webe[4]. In the first step, I used typical
preprocessing techniques like the removal of punctuation to prepare the
data for the machine learning model. I then did some Exploratory Data
Analysis to get insight to the data and extract new features. After that I
tested different possibilities to train and test the machine learning mod-
els like using new features or testing whether the Z-normalization does
make a difference in model performance. The traditional machine learn-
ing model with the best performance was the Logistic Regression with
94,3% accuracy.
